	abstract = {A key part of a recommender system is a collaborative filtering
algorithm predicting users’ preferences for items. In this
paper we describe different efficient collaborative filtering
techniques and a framework for combining them to obtain a
good prediction.
The methods described in this paper are the most important
parts of a solution predicting users’ preferences for
movies with error rate 7.04\% better on the Netflix Prize
dataset than the reference algorithm Netflix Cinematch.
The set of predictors used includes algorithms suggested
by Netflix Prize contestants: regularized singular value decomposition
of data with missing values, K-means, postprocessing
{SVD} with {KNN}. We propose extending the set of
predictors with the following methods: addition of biases to
the regularized {SVD}, postprocessing {SVD} with kernel ridge
regression, using a separate linear model for each movie,
and using methods similar to the regularized {SVD}, but with
fewer parameters.
All predictors and selected 2-way interactions between
them are combined using linear regression on a holdout set.},

	abstract = {The collaborative filtering approach to recommender systems predicts user preferences for products or services by learning past user-item relationships. In this work, we propose novel algorithms for predicting user ratings of items by integrating complementary models that focus on patterns at different scales. At a local scale, we use a neighborhood-based technique that infers ratings from observed ratings by similar users or of similar items. Unlike previous local approaches, our method is based on a formal model that accounts for interactions within the neighborhood, leading to improved estimation quality. At a higher, regional, scale, we use {SVD}-like matrix factorization for recovering the major structural patterns in the user-item rating matrix. Unlike previous approaches that require imputations in order to fill in the unknown matrix entries, our new iterative algorithm avoids imputation. Because the models involve estimation of millions, or even billions, of parameters, shrinkage of estimated values to account for sampling variability proves crucial to prevent overfitting. Both the local and the regional approaches, and in particular their combination through a unifying model, compare favorably with other approaches and deliver substantially better results than the commercial Netflix Cinematch recommender system on a large publicly available data set.},

	abstract = {Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes ({MDPs}) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. {MDPs} introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an {MDP}-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular {MDP} model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the first to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our {MDP}-based approach.},

As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of {EDM} approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict {EDM} approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the {EDM} approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed {EDM} works, and provides an analysis of the {EDM} strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled.},

	abstract = {In many commercial systems, the 'best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as {RMSE}) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing {RMSE} do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in {RMSE} often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their {RMSE}, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.},

For that reason, we reviewed 210 articles on recommender systems from 46 journals published between 2001 and 2010, and then classified those by the year of publication, the journals in which they appeared, their application fields, and their data mining techniques. The 210 articles are categorized into eight application fields (books, documents, images, movie, music, shopping, {TV} programs, and others) and eight data mining techniques (association rule, clustering, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, link analysis, neural network, regression, and other heuristic methods). Our research provides information about trends in recommender systems research by examining the publication years of the articles, and provides practitioners and researchers with insight and future direction on recommender systems.

Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting {SPARse} Factor Analysis ({SPARFA}) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between {SPARFA} and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.},

Two of the most popular approaches are based on matrix factorization ({MF}) and Markov chains ({MC}). {MF} methods learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item preferences. On the other hand, {MC} methods model sequential behavior by learning a transition graph over items that is used to predict the next action based on the recent actions of a user. In this paper, we present a method bringing both approaches together. Our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying Markov chains. That means for each user an own transition matrix is learned - thus in total the method uses a transition cube. As the observations for estimating the transitions are usually very limited, our method factorizes the transition cube with a pairwise interaction model which is a special case of the Tucker Decomposition. We show that our factorized personalized {MC} ({FPMC}) model subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model. For learning the model parameters, we introduce an adaption of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking ({BPR}) framework for sequential basket data. Empirically, we show that our {FPMC} model outperforms both the common matrix factorization and the unpersonalized {MC} model both learned with and without factorization.},

After considering community level detection performance measured by Normalized Mutual Information, the Omega index, and node level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, {SLPA}, {OSLOM}, Game and {COPRA} offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both {SLPA} and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a method to make personalized recommendations when user preferences change over time. Most of the works in the recommender systems literature have been developed under the assumption that user preference has a static pattern. However, this is a strong assumption especially when the user is observed over a long period of time. With the help of a data set on employees' blog reading behavior, we show that users' product selection behaviors change over time. We propose a hidden Markov model to correctly interpret the users' product selection behaviors and make personalized recommendations. The user preference is modeled as a hidden Markov sequence. A variable number of product selections of different types by each user in each time period requires a novel observation model. We propose a negative binomial mixture of multinomial to model such observations. This allows us to identify stable global preferences of users and to track individual users through these preferences. We evaluate our model using three real-world data sets with different characteristics. They include data on employee blog reading behavior inside a firm, users' movie rating behavior at Netflix, and users' music listening behavior collected through last.fm. We compare the recommendation performance of the proposed model with that of a number of collaborative filtering algorithms and a recently proposed temporal link prediction algorithm. We find that the proposed {HMM}-based collaborative filter performs as well as the best among the alternative algorithms when the data is sparse or static. However, it outperforms the existing algorithms when the data is less sparse and the user preference is changing. We further examine the performances of the algorithms using simulated data with different characteristics and highlight the scenarios where it is beneficial to use a dynamic model to generate product recommendation.},

Recently, they are also applied in e-learning tasks such as recommending resources (e.g. papers, books,..) to the learners (students). In this work, we propose a novel approach which uses recommender system techniques for educational data mining, especially for predicting student performance. To validate this approach, we compare recommender system techniques with traditional regression methods such as logistic/linear regression by using educational data for intelligent tutoring systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve prediction results.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems based on latent factor models have been effectively used for understanding user interests and predicting future actions. Such models work by projecting the users and items into a smaller dimensional space, thereby clustering similar users and items together and subsequently compute similarity between unknown user-item pairs. When user-item interactions are sparse (sparsity problem) or when new items continuously appear (cold start problem), these models perform poorly. In this paper, we exploit the combination of taxonomies and latent factor models to mitigate these issues and improve recommendation accuracy. We observe that taxonomies provide structure similar to that of a latent factor model: namely, it imposes human-labeled categories (clusters) over items. This leads to our proposed taxonomy-aware latent factor model ({TF}) which combines taxonomies and latent factors using additive models. We develop efficient algorithms to train the {TF} models, which scales to large number of users/items and develop scalable inference/recommendation algorithms by exploiting the structure of the taxonomy. In addition, we extend the {TF} model to account for the temporal dynamics of user interests using high-order Markov chains. To deal with large-scale data, we develop a parallel multi-core implementation of our {TF} model. We empirically evaluate the {TF} model for the task of predicting user purchases using a real-world shopping dataset spanning more than a million users and products. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of using our {TF} models over existing approaches, in terms of both prediction accuracy and running time.},

In this paper, we introduce and explore a number of item ranking techniques that can generate substantially more diverse recommendations across all users while maintaining comparable levels of recommendation accuracy.

These systems often rely on collaborating filtering ({CF}), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The most common approach to {CF} is based on neighborhood models, which originate from similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce a new neighborhood model with an improved prediction accuracy. Unlike previous approaches that are based on heuristic similarities, we model neighborhood relations by minimizing a global cost function. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the model to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. Past models were limited by the need to compute all pairwise similarities between items or users, which grow quadratically with input size. In particular, this limitation vastly complicates adopting user similarity models, due to the typical large number of users. Our new model solves these limitations by factoring the neighborhood model, thus making both item-item and user-user implementations scale linearly with the size of the data. The methods are tested on the Netflix data, with encouraging results.},

We perform probabilistic analyses of algorithmic methods within this framework. These analyses yield insights into how much utility can be derived from the memory of past actions and on how this memory can be exploited. 1. Introduction  Collaborative filtering (sometimes known as a recommendation  system) is a process by which information on the preferences and actions of a group of users is tracked by a system which then, based on the patterns it observes, tries to make useful recommendations to individual users [10, 12, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23].

A system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model. Learning the model parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive. The commonly used {EM} algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in {IR} applications. This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user profiles.

Factorization models based on the Tucker Decomposition ({TD}) model have been shown to provide high quality tag recommendations outperforming other approaches like {PageRank}, {FolkRank}, collaborative filtering, etc. The problem with {TD} models is the cubic core tensor resulting in a cubic runtime in the factorization dimension for prediction and learning. In this paper, we present the factorization model {PITF} (Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization) which is a special case of the {TD} model with linear runtime both for learning and prediction. {PITF} explicitly models the pairwise interactions between users, items and tags. The model is learned with an adaption of the Bayesian personalized ranking ({BPR}) criterion which originally has been introduced for item recommendation. Empirically, we show on real world datasets that this model outperforms {TD} largely in runtime and even can achieve better prediction quality. Besides our lab experiments, {PITF} has also won the {ECML}/{PKDD} Discovery Challenge 2009 for graph-based tag recommendation.},

Learner models are now embedded in real world applications which can claim to have thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of users. Probabilistic models for skill assessment are playing a key role in these advanced learning environments. In this paper, we review the learner models that have played the largest roles in the success of these learning environments, and also the latest advances in the modeling and assessment of learner skills. We conclude by discussing related advancements in modeling other key constructs such as learner motivation, emotional and attentional state, meta-cognition and self-regulated learning, group learning, and the recent movement towards open and shared learner models.},

One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to handle changing user preferences over time. Recent proposals to address this issue are heuristic in nature and do not fully exploit the time-dependent structure of the problem. As a principled and general temporal formulation, we propose a dynamical state space model of matrix factorization. Our proposal builds upon probabilistic matrix factorization, a Bayesian model with Gaussian priors. We utilize results in state tracking, i.e. the Kalman filter, to provide accurate recommendations in the presence of both process and measurement noise. We show how system parameters can be learned via expectation-maximization and provide comparisons to current published techniques.},

In fact, our model provides a single unified framework to address both cold and warm start scenarios that are commonplace in practical applications like recommender systems, online advertising, web search, etc. We provide scalable and accurate model fitting methods based on Iterated Conditional Mode and Monte Carlo {EM} algorithms. We show our model induces a stochastic process on the dyadic space with kernel (covariance) given by a polynomial function of features. Methods that generalize our procedure to estimate factors in an online fashion for dynamic applications are also considered. Our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a novel content recommendation application that arises in the context of Yahoo! Front Page. We report significant improvements over several commonly used methods on all datasets.},

So far, the best performing method for context-aware rating prediction in terms of predictive accuracy is Multiverse Recommendation based on the Tucker tensor factorization model. However this method has two drawbacks: (1) its model complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables. On the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods. We propose to apply Factorization Machines ({FMs}) to model contextual information and to provide context-aware rating predictions. This approach results in fast context-aware recommendations because the model equation of {FMs} can be computed in linear time both in the number of context variables and the factorization size. For learning {FMs}, we develop an iterative optimization method that analytically finds the least-square solution for one parameter given the other ones. Finally, we show empirically that our approach outperforms Multiverse Recommendation in prediction quality and runtime.},

The practical importance of improving understanding of how students learn is to build better intelligent tutors. The expected advantages of our integrated approach include (i) more accurate prediction of a student's future performance, and (ii) clustering items into skills automatically, without expensive manual expert knowledge annotation. We introduce a unified model, Dynamic Cognitive Tracing, to explain student learning in terms of skill mastery over time, by learning the Cognitive Model and the Student Model jointly. We formulate our approach as a graphical model, and we validate it using sixty different synthetic datasets. Dynamic Cognitive Tracing significantly outperforms single-skill Knowledge Tracing on predicting future student performance. (Contains 9 figures and 3 tables.)

However, building this understanding into a computer-based intelligent tutor is a time-intensive process usually conducted by subject experts. Much of this time is spent in building production rules that model all the ways a student might solve a problem. In our prior work, we proposed a novel application of Markov decision processes ({MDPs}) to automatically generate hints for an intelligent tutor that learns. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by extracting {MDPs} from four semesters of student solutions in a logic proof tutor, and calculating the probability that we will be able to generate hints for students at any point in a given problem. Our past results indicated that extracted {MDPs} and our proposed hint-generating functions will be able to provide hints over 80 \% of the time. Our results also indicated that we can provide valuable tradeoffs between hint specificity and the amount of data used to create an {MDP}.},

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms.},

We identify certain novel parameters of mixture models that are closely connected with the best achievable performance of a recommendation algorithm; we show that for any system in which these parameters are bounded, it is possible to give recommendations whose quality converges to optimal as the amount of data grows.

All our bounds depend on a new measure of independence that can be viewed as an L 1 -analogue of the smallest singular value of a matrix. Using this, we introduce a technique based on generalized pseudoinverse matrices and linear programming for handling sets of high-dimensional vectors. We also show that standard approaches based on L 2 spectral methods are not strong enough to yield comparable results, thereby suggesting some inherent limitations of spectral analysis.},

At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering.

	abstract = {Methods that accurately predict the grade of a student at a given activity and/or course can identify students that are at risk in failing a course and allow their educational institution to take corrective actions. Though a number of approaches have been developed for building such performance prediction models, they either estimate a single model for all students based on their past course performance and interactions with learning management systems ({LMS}), or estimate student-specific models that do not take into account {LMS} interactions; thus, failing to exploit fine-grain information related to a student’s engagement and effort in a course. In this work we present a class of linear multi-regression models that are designed to produce models that are personalized to each student and also take into account a large number of features that relate to a student’s past performance, course characteristics, and student’s engagement and effort. These models estimate a small number of regression models that are shared across the different students along with student- specific linear combination functions to facilitate personalization. Our experimental evaluation on a large set of students, courses, and activities shows that these models are capable of improving the performance prediction accuracy by over 20\%. In addition, we show that by analyzing the estimated models along with the student-specific combination functions we can gain insights on the effectiveness of the educational material that is made available at the courses of different departments.},

However, building this understanding into a computer-based intelligent tutor is a time-intensive process usually conducted by subject experts. Much of this time is spent in building production rules that model all the ways a student might solve a problem. In our prior work, we proposed a novel application of Markov decision processes ({MDPs}) to automatically generate hints for an intelligent tutor that learns. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by extracting {MDPs} from four semesters of student solutions in a logic proof tutor, and calculating the probability that we will be able to generate hints for students at any point in a given problem. Our past results indicated that extracted {MDPs} and our proposed hint-generating functions will be able to provide hints over 80 \% of the time. Our results also indicated that we can provide valuable tradeoffs between hint specificity and the amount of data used to create an {MDP}.},

	abstract = {Customer preferences for products are drifting over time. Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics is essential for designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the ecosystem intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too many signals when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long-term patterns. We show how to model the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. Such a model allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie-rating dataset underlying the Netflix Prize contest. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset. In particular, methods described in this paper play a significant role in the solution that won the Netflix contest.},

In this paper, we introduce a new method to improve the information used in collaborative filtering processes by weighting the ratings of the items according to their importance. We provide here a formalisation of the collaborative filtering process based on the concept of significance. In this way, the k-neighbours are calculated taking into account the ratings of the items, the significance of the items and the significance of each user for making recommendations to other users. This formalisation includes extensions of the concepts related to similarity measures and prediction/recommendation quality measures. We will show also the results obtained from a set of experiments using Movielens and Netflix. The results confirm the advantage of introducing the concept of significance in general recommender systems and especially in recommender systems in which it is easy to determine the relative importance of the items: for example, most widely sold products in e-commerce, most widely commented news items in web-news, most widely watched programs on {TV}, and the latest sports champions.},

	abstract = {A long-standing challenge for knowledge tracing is how to update estimates of multiple subskills that underlie a single observable step. We characterize approaches to this problem by how they model knowledge tracing, fit its parameters, predict performance, and update subskill estimates. Previous methods allocated blame or credit among subskills in various ways based on strong assumptions about their relation to observed performance. {LR}-{DBN} relaxes these assumptions by using logistic regression in a Dynamic Bayes Net. {LR}-{DBN} significantly outperforms previous methods on data sets from reading and algebra tutors in terms of predictive accuracy on unseen data, cutting the error rate by half. An ablation experiment shows that using logistic regression to predict performance helps, but that using it to jointly estimate subskills explains most of this dramatic improvement. An implementation of {LR}-{DBN} is now publicly available in the {BNT}-{SM} student modeling toolkit. Instruction to use {LR}-{DBN} in {BNT}-{SM} is appended.

	abstract = {Rating and recommendation systems have become a popular application area for applying a suite of machine learning techniques. Current approaches rely primarily on probabilistic interpretations and extensions of matrix factorization, which factorizes a user-item ratings matrix into latent user and item vectors. Most of these methods fail to model significant variations in item ratings from otherwise similar users, a phenomenon known as the "Napoleon Dynamite" effect. Recent efforts have addressed this problem by adding a contextual bias term to the rating, which captures the mood under which a user rates an item or the context in which an item is rated by a user. In this work, we extend this model in a nonparametric sense by learning the optimal number of moods or contexts from the data, and derive Gibbs sampling inference procedures for our model. We evaluate our approach on the {MovieLens} 1M dataset, and show significant improvements over the optimal parametric baseline, more than twice the improvements previously encountered for this task. We also extract and evaluate a {DBLP} dataset, wherein we predict the number of papers co-authored by two authors, and present improvements over the parametric baseline on this alternative domain as well.},

The resulting research progress has established the importance of the user-item (U-I) matrix, which encodes the individual preferences of users for items in a collection, for recommender systems. The U-I matrix provides the basis for collaborative filtering ({CF}) techniques, the dominant framework for recommender systems. Currently, new recommendation scenarios are emerging that offer promising new information that goes beyond the U-I matrix. This information can be divided into two categories related to its source: rich side information concerning users and items, and interaction information associated with the interplay of users and items. In this survey, we summarize and analyze recommendation scenarios involving information sources and the {CF} algorithms that have been recently developed to address them. We provide a comprehensive introduction to a large body of research, more than 200 key references, with the aim of supporting the further development of recommender systems exploiting information beyond the U-I matrix. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss what we see as the central challenges lying ahead for recommender system technology, both in terms of extensions of existing techniques as well as of the integration of techniques and technologies drawn from other research areas.},

There is a need for algorithms that can incrementally update and monitor communities whose evolution generates huge realtime data streams, such as the Internet or on-line social networks. In this paper, we propose {LabelRankT}, an online distributed algorithm for detection of communities in large-scale dynamic networks through stabilized label propagation. Results of tests on real-world networks demonstrate that {LabelRankT} has much lower computational costs than other algorithms. It also improves the quality of the detected communities compared to dynamic detection methods and matches the quality achieved by static detection approaches. Unlike most of other algorithms which apply only to binary networks, {LabelRankT} works on weighted and directed networks, which provides a flexible and promising solution for real-world applications.},

So far, the best performing method for context-aware rating prediction in terms of predictive accuracy is Multiverse Recommendation based on the Tucker tensor factorization model. However this method has two drawbacks: (1) its model complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables. On the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods. We propose to apply Factorization Machines ({FMs}) to model contextual information and to provide context-aware rating predictions. This approach results in fast context-aware recommendations because the model equation of {FMs} can be computed in linear time both in the number of context variables and the factorization size. For learning {FMs}, we develop an iterative optimization method that analytically finds the least-square solution for one parameter given the other ones. Finally, we show empirically that our approach outperforms Multiverse Recommendation in prediction quality and runtime.},

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a general technique for exploiting the preference patterns of a group of users to predict the utility of items for a particular user. Three different components need to be modeled in a collaborative filtering problem: users, items, and ratings. Previous research on applying probabilistic models to collaborative filtering has shown promising results. However, there is a lack of systematic studies of different ways to model each of the three components and their interactions. In this paper, we conduct a broad and systematic study on different mixture models for collaborative filtering. We discuss general issues related to using a mixture model for collaborative filtering, and propose three properties that a graphical model is expected to satisfy. Using these properties, we thoroughly examine five different mixture models, including Bayesian Clustering ({BC}), Aspect Model ({AM}), Flexible Mixture Model ({FMM}), Joint Mixture Model ({JMM}), and the Decoupled Model ({DM}). We compare these models both analytically and experimentally. Experiments over two datasets of movie ratings under different configurations show that in general, whether a model satisfies the proposed properties tends to be correlated with its performance. In particular, the Decoupled Model, which satisfies all the three desired properties, outperforms the other mixture models as well as many other existing approaches for collaborative filtering. Our study shows that graphical models are powerful tools for modeling collaborative filtering, but careful design is necessary to achieve good performance.},

In fact, nowadays there is increasing interest in the use of discussion forums as an indicator of student performance. In this respect, this paper proposes the use of different data mining approaches for improving prediction of students' final performance starting from participation indicators in both quantitative, qualitative and social network forums. Our objective is to determine how the selection of instances and attributes, the use of different classification algorithms and the date when data is gathered affect the accuracy and comprehensibility of the prediction. A new Moodle's module for gathering forum indicators was developed and different executions were carried out using real data from 114 university students during a first-year course in computer science. A representative set of traditional classification algorithms have been used and compared versus classification via clustering algorithms for predicting whether students will pass or fail the course on the basis of data about their forum usage. The results obtained indicate the suitability of performing both a final prediction at the end of the course and an early prediction before the end of the course; of applying clustering plus class association rules mining instead of traditional classification for obtaining highly interpretable student performance models; and of using a subset of attributes instead of all available attributes, and not all forum messages but only students' messages with content related to the subject of the course for improving classification accuracy.},

The experiments in this paper analyzed those results to determine why this occurred. Our assessment showed that while the queries entered by real users into systems yielding better results in batch studies gave comparable gains in ranking of relevant documents for those users, they did not translate into better performance on specific tasks.

In an {HMM}, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable—the hidden state. We discuss a generalization of {HMMs} in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward–backward algorithm for {HMMs} and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial {HMMs} can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained {HMM} cannot.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to document classification requires labeled data in order to construct reliable and accurate classifiers. Unfortunately, labeled data are seldom available, and often too expensive to obtain. Given a learning task for which training data are not available, abundant labeled data may exist for a different but related domain. One would like to use the related labeled data as auxiliary information to accomplish the classification task in the target domain. Recently, the paradigm of transfer learning has been introduced to enable effective learning strategies when auxiliary data obey a different probability distribution. A co-clustering based classification algorithm has been previously proposed to tackle cross-domain text classification. In this work, we extend the idea underlying this approach by making the latent semantic relationship between the two domains explicit. This goal is achieved with the use of Wikipedia. As a result, the pathway that allows to propagate labels between the two domains not only captures common words, but also semantic concepts based on the content of documents. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our semantic-based approach to cross-domain classification using a variety of real data.},

	abstract = {In recent years, co-clustering has emerged as a powerful data mining tool that can analyze dyadic data connecting two entities. However, almost all existing co-clustering techniques are partitional, and allow individual rows and columns of a data matrix to belong to only one cluster. Several current applications, such as recommendation systems and market basket analysis, can substantially benefit from a mixed membership of rows and columns. In this paper, we present Bayesian co-clustering ({BCC}) models, that allow a mixed membership in row and column clusters. {BCC} maintains separate Dirichlet priors for rows and columns over the mixed membership and assumes each observation to be generated by an exponential family distribution corresponding to its row and column clusters. We propose a fast variational algorithm for inference and parameter estimation. The model is designed to naturally handle sparse matrices as the inference is done only based on the nonmissing entries. In addition to finding a co-cluster structure in observations, the model outputs a low dimensional coembedding, and accurately predicts missing values in the original matrix. We demonstrate the efficacy of the model through experiments on both simulated and real data. 1},

	abstract = {Co-clustering has emerged as an important technique for mining contingency data matrices. However, almost all existing co-clustering algorithms are hard partitioning, assigning each row and column of the data matrix to one cluster. Recently a Bayesian co-clustering approach has been proposed which allows a probability distribution membership in row and column clusters. The approach uses variational inference for parameter estimation. In this work, we modify the Bayesian co-clustering model, and use collapsed Gibbs sampling and collapsed variational inference for parameter estimation. Our empirical evaluation on real data sets shows that both collapsed Gibbs sampling and collapsed variational inference are able to find more accurate likelihood estimates than the standard variational Bayesian co-clustering approach.},

	abstract = {In graph-based learning models, entities are often represented as vertices in an undirected graph with weighted edges describing the relationships between entities. In many real-world applications, however, entities are often associated with relations of different types and/or from different sources, which can be well captured by multiple undirected graphs over the same set of vertices. How to exploit such multiple sources of information to make better inferences on entities remains an interesting open problem. In this paper, we focus on the problem of clustering the vertices based on multiple graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. As one of our contributions, we propose Linked Matrix Factorization ({LMF}) as a novel way of fusing information from multiple graph sources. In {LMF}, each graph is approximated by matrix factorization with a graph-specific factor and a factor common to all graphs, where the common factor provides features for all vertices. Experiments on {SIAM} journal data show that (1) we can improve the clustering accuracy through fusing multiple sources of information with several models, and (2) {LMF} yields superior or competitive results compared to other graph-based clustering methods.},

In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metr rics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.},

Such models are usually fitted to data by finding a {MAP} estimate of the model parameters, a procedure that can be performed efficiently even on very large datasets. However, unless the regularization parameters are tuned carefully, this approach is prone to overfitting because it finds a single point estimate of the parameters. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian treatment of the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization ({PMF}) model in which model capacity is controlled automatically by integrating over all model parameters and hyperparameters. We show that Bayesian {PMF} models can be efficiently trained using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods by applying them to the Netflix dataset, which consists of over 100 million movie ratings. The resulting models achieve significantly higher prediction accuracy than {PMF} models trained using {MAP} estimation.},

We present a new alternative that is independent of user rating scales and is based on what we call predictive probabilities. We explore how these probabilities can be used to select nearest neighbors for recommendations and integrate different types of dependence in the ratings. The neighborhood selection criterion depends on the capability of a user to predict past ratings. Our hypothesis is that if a user was good when predicting past ratings for an active user, then his predictions will also be helpful in recommending ratings for the same user in the future.},

We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes ({MDP}) provide a more appropriate model for Recommender systems. {MDPs} introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an {MDP}-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the initial {MDP}. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models. We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an {MDP}-based Recommender system.},

In contrast to centralized recommender systems, in which there is a single centralized seller who has access to the complete inventory of items as well as the complete record of sales and user information, in decentralized recommender systems each seller/learner only has access to the inventory of items and user information for its own products and not the products and user information of other sellers, but can get commission if it sells an item of another seller. Therefore, the sellers must distributedly find out for an incoming user which items to recommend (from the set of own items or items of another seller), in order to maximize the revenue from own sales and commissions. We formulate this problem as a cooperative contextual bandit problem, analytically bound the performance of the sellers compared to the best recommendation strategy given the complete realization of user arrivals and the inventory of items, as well as the context-dependent purchase probabilities of each item, and verify our results via numerical examples on a distributed data set adapted based on Amazon data. We evaluate the dependence of the performance of a seller on the inventory of items the seller has, the number of connections it has with the other sellers, and the commissions which the seller gets by selling items of other sellers to its users.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many {MCMC} methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, {HMC}'s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler ({NUTS}), an extension to {HMC} that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. {NUTS} uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, {NUTS} perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard {HMC} method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. {NUTS} can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. {NUTS} is also suitable for applications such as {BUGS}-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution.

	title = {Hidden topic Markov models},
	abstract = {Algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) have achieved significant progress in modeling word document relationships. These algorithms assume each word in the document was generated by a hidden topic and explicitly model the word distribution of each topic as well as the prior distribution over topics in the document. Given these parameters, the topics of all words in the same document are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we propose modeling the topics of words in the document as a Markov chain. Specifically, we assume that all words in the same sentence have the same topic, and successive sentences are more likely to have the same topics. Since the topics are hidden, this leads to using the well-known tools of Hidden Markov Models for learning and inference. We show that incorporating this dependency allows us to learn better topics and to disambiguate words that can belong to different topics. Quantitatively, we show that we obtain better perplexity in modeling documents with only a modest increase in learning and inference complexity. 1},

But watching movie is a special behavior, in which users' interests should not just be represented by their ratings. We think that the decision to watch a movie also reflects the target users' needs, even though he or she may give it a low rating. In this paper, we introduce two factors, i.e. Users' Tastes and Users' Choices to describe users' needs. The analysis of relationships between them gives us a new explanation for the layered structure of users' ratings. Then, inspired by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory, we present a layered perspective of users' interests and design an efficient and effective recommendation strategy based on collaborative filtering models to meet users' layered needs.},

While career and elective {STEM} courses had significantly higher success rates face-to-face than liberal arts and major requirement {STEM} courses respectively, career {STEM} courses had significantly higher success rates online than would be expected, while elective {STEM} courses had significantly lower success rates online than would be expected given the face-to-face results. Once propensity score matching was used to generate a matched subsample which was balanced on a number of student characteristics, differences in course outcomes by course characteristics were no longer significant. This suggests that while certain types of {STEM} courses can be identified as higher or lower risk in the online environment, this appears not to be because of the courses themselves, but rather because of the particular characteristics of the students who choose to take these courses online. Findings suggests that one potential intervention for improving online {STEM} course outcomes could be to target students in specific courses which are at higher risk in the online environment; this may allow institutions to leverage interventions by focusing them on the {STEM} courses at greatest risk of lower online success rates, where the students who are at highest risk of online dropout seem to be concentrated.},

The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},

Are there suitable extensions to leverage side information? Are there benefits to taking into account row and column biases? We develop new families of {PMF} models to address these questions along with efficient approximate inference algorithms for learning and prediction. Through extensive experiments on movie recommendation datasets, we illustrate that simpler models directly capturing correlations among latent factors can outperform existing {PMF} models, side information can benefit prediction accuracy, and accounting for row/column biases leads to improvements in predictive performance.},

The second direction which suits the online knowledge discovery problem is to embed data-driven semantics. The idea is to construct the current latent Dirichlet alglocation ({LDA}) model based on information propagated from topic models that were learned from previously seen documents of the domain. The chapter focuses on three major advancements to solve the problem such as vector space modeling, latent semantic analysis and probabilistic latent semantic analysis. It introduces the {LDA} topic model with a brief description of its graphical model and generative process and the posterior inference. The chapter investigates the role of embedding semantics from a source by enhancing the generative process of the model parameters. It provides an online version of {LDA}, namely {OLDA}.

This paper introduces a new approach to the problem which does not make such an assumption. We personalize active learning for the user, and query for only those items which the user can provide rating for. We propose an extended form of Bayesian active learning and use the Aspect Model for {CF} to illustrate and examine the idea. A comparative evaluation of the new method and a well-established baseline method on benchmark datasets shows statistically significant improvements with our method over the performance of the baseline method that is representative for existing approaches which do not take personalization into account.},

	abstract = {A key challenge in recommender system research is how to effectively profile new users, a problem generally known as cold-start recommendation. Recently the idea of progressively querying user responses through an initial interview process has been proposed as a useful new user preference elicitation strategy. In this paper, we present functional matrix factorization ({fMF}), a novel cold-start recommendation method that solves the problem of initial interview construction within the context of learning user and item profiles. Specifically, {fMF} constructs a decision tree for the initial interview with each node being an interview question, enabling the recommender to query a user adaptively according to her prior responses. More importantly, we associate latent profiles for each node of the tree --- in effect restricting the latent profiles to be a function of possible answers to the interview questions --- which allows the profiles to be gradually refined through the interview process based on user responses. We develop an iterative optimization algorithm that alternates between decision tree construction and latent profiles extraction as well as a regularization scheme that takes into account of the tree structure. Experimental results on three benchmark recommendation data sets demonstrate that the proposed {fMF} algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for cold-start recommendation.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDM.2007.90},
	abstract = {Recommender systems based on collaborative filtering predict user preferences for products or services by learning past user-item relationships. A predominant approach to collaborative filtering is neighborhood based ("k-nearest neighbors"), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called "global effects" from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. Finally, we show how to apply these methods to the perceivably much slower user-oriented approach. To this end, we suggest a novel scheme for low dimensional embedding of the users. We evaluate these methods on the netflix dataset, where they deliver significantly better results than the commercial netflix cinematch recommender system.},

Many of these approaches can be viewed as minimizing a generalized Bregman divergence, and we show that (i) a straightforward alternating projection algorithm can be applied to almost any model in our unified view; (ii) the Hessian for each projection has special structure that makes a Newton projection feasible, even when there are equality constraints on the factors, which allows for matrix co-clustering; and (iii) alternating projections can be generalized to simultaneously factor a set of matrices that share dimensions. These observations immediately yield new optimization algorithms for the above factorization methods, and suggest novel generalizations of these methods such as incorporating row and column biases, and adding or relaxing clustering constraints.},

Users develop projects, which are graphical interfaces involving manipulation of programming blocks. We investigated two fundamental questions: how can we model informal learning, and what patterns of informal learning emerge. We proceeded in two phases. First, we modeled learning as a trajectory of cumulative programming block usage by long-term users who created at least 50 projects. Second, we applied K-means++ clustering to uncover patterns of learning and corresponding subpopulations. We found four groups of users manifesting four different patterns of learning, ranging from the smallest to the largest improvement. At one end of the spectrum, users learned more and in a faster manner. At the opposite end, users did not show much learning, even after creating dozens of projects. The modeling and clustering of trajectory patterns that enabled us to quantitatively analyze informal learning may be applicable to other similar communities. The results can also support administrators of online communities in implementing customized interventions for specific subpopulations.},

In particular, existing collaborative filtering ({CF}) approaches take into account only the binary events of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users' decisions are made. In this paper, we propose Collaborative Competitive Filtering ({CCF}), a framework for learning user preferences by modeling the choice process in recommender systems. {CCF} employs a multiplicative latent factor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike {CF}, {CCF} models the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In this way, {CCF} allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped together with missing data in existing {CF} models. We present two formulations and an efficient large scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on three real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that {CCF} significantly outperforms standard {CF} approaches in both offline and online evaluations.},

These systems have succeeded in domains as diverse as movies, news articles, Web pages, and wines. The psychological literature on conformity suggests that in the course of helping people make choices, these systems probably affect users' opinions of the items. If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items. We find that users rate fairly consistently across rating scales. Users can be manipulated, though, tending to rate toward the prediction the system shows, whether the prediction is accurate or not. However, users can detect systems that manipulate predictions. We discuss how designers of recommender systems might react to these findings.},

This problem has been addressed by the reinforcement learning community but they do not consider the risk level of the current user's situation, where it may be dangerous to recommend items the user may not desire in her current situation if the risk level is high.

To compute predictions in such cases, additional information about users (user attributes, e.g. gender, age, geographical location, occupation) and items (item attributes, e.g. genres, product categories, keywords) must be used. We describe a method that maps such entity (e.g. user or item) attributes to the latent features of a matrix (or higher-dimensional) factorization model. With such mappings, the factors of a {MF} model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy. We use the mapping concept to construct an attribute-aware matrix factorization model for item recommendation from implicit, positive-only feedback. Experiments on the new-item problem show that this approach provides good predictive accuracy, while the prediction time only grows by a constant factor.},

They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. This paper discusses a{\textasciitilde}wide variety of the choices available and their implications, aiming to provide both practicioners and researchers with an introduction to the important issues underlying recommenders and current best practices for addressing these issues.},

Three different components need to be modeled in a collaborative filtering problem: users, items, and ratings. Previous research on applying probabilistic models to collaborative filtering has shown promising results. However, there is a lack of systematic studies of different ways to model each of the three components and their interactions. In this paper, we conduct a broad and systematic study on different mixture models for collaborative filtering. We discuss general issues related to using a mixture model for collaborative filtering, and propose three properties that a graphical model is expected to satisfy. Using these properties, we thoroughly examine five different mixture models, including Bayesian Clustering ({BC}), Aspect Model ({AM}), Flexible Mixture Model ({FMM}), Joint Mixture Model ({JMM}), and the Decoupled Model ({DM}). We compare these models both analytically and experimentally. Experiments over two datasets of movie ratings under different configurations show that in general, whether a model satisfies the proposed properties tends to be correlated with its performance. In particular, the Decoupled Model, which satisfies all the three desired properties, outperforms the other mixture models as well as many other existing approaches for collaborative filtering. Our study shows that graphical models are powerful tools for modeling collaborative filtering, but careful design is necessary to achieve good performance.},

	abstract = {The K-means clustering problem seeks to partition the columns of a data matrix in subsets, such that columns in the same subset are 'close' to each other. The co-clustering problem seeks to simultaneously partition the rows and columns of a matrix to produce 'coherent' groups called co-clusters. Co-clustering has recently found numerous applications in diverse areas. The concept readily generalizes to higher-way data sets (e.g., adding a temporal dimension). Starting from K-means, we show how co-clustering can be formulated as constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. In the case of three- and higher-way data, this corresponds to a {PARAFAC} decomposition with sparse latent factors. This is important, for {PARAFAC} is unique under mild conditions and sparsity further improves identifiability. This allows us to uniquely unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters that are hidden in the data. Interestingly, the imposition of latent sparsity pays a collateral dividend: as one increases the number of fitted co-clusters, new co-clusters are added without affecting those previously extracted. An important corollary is that co-clusters can be extracted incrementally; this implies that the algorithm scales well for large datasets. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using the {ENRON} corpus, as well as synthetic data.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an effort to model students' changing knowledge state during skill acquisition. Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the {ACT} Programming Tutor ({APT}). {APT} is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.},

	abstract = {Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products). In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization ({MF}) or adaptive k-nearest-neighbor ({kNN}). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion {BPR}-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to {BPR}-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive {kNN}. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for {MF} and {kNN}. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.},

	abstract = {A content-based personalized recommendation system learns user specific profiles from user feedback so that it can deliver information tailored to each individual user's interest. A system serving millions of users can learn a better user profile for a new user, or a user with little feedback, by borrowing information from other users through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model. Learning the model parameters to optimize the joint data likelihood from millions of users is very computationally expensive. The commonly used {EM} algorithm converges very slowly due to the sparseness of the data in {IR} applications. This paper proposes a new fast learning technique to learn a large number of individual user profiles. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are justified by theory and demonstrated on actual user data from Netflix and {MovieLens}.},

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering ({CF}) is a data analysis task appearing in many challenging applications, in particular data mining in Internet and e-commerce. {CF} can often be formulated as identifying patterns in a large and mostly empty rating matrix. In this paper, we focus on predicting unobserved ratings. This task is often a part of a recommendation procedure. We propose a new {CF} approach called interlaced generalized linear models ({GLM}); it is based on a factorization of the rating matrix and uses probabilistic modeling to represent uncertainty in the ratings. The advantage of this approach is that different configurations, encoding different intuitions about the rating process can easily be tested while keeping the same learning procedure. The {GLM} formulation is the keystone to derive an efficient learning procedure, applicable to large datasets. We illustrate the technique on three public domain datasets.},
