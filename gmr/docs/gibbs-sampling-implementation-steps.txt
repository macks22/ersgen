1.  Identify all conditional distributions
2.  Determine if each is conjugate
3.  Identify update rules for each
4.  If collapsing, identify collapsed conditional distributions and identify
    update rules for those
5.  Write out sampling procedure as an algorithm.
6.  Generate synthetic data using the generative process from the model.
7.  Implement the algorithm and verify that it recovers the parameters used in
    synthetic data generation. Revise if necessary.
8.  Test on real data.
9.  Interpret the results.
10. Identify assumptions made in the model. Look at each distribution and each
    parent-child relationship in the graphical model.
11. Determine if the assumptions are realistic. Revise model if they're not.
12. Report on the results.
